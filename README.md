# Game List App

Built using: React, react-router-dom, CSS Grid

# Before running the app, make sure you get an api key from https://www.igdb.com/api, then create a file called .env with value REACT_APP_USER_KEY = your_user-key

Recreated my previous Angular project with React without the help of Bootstrap or IGDB API wrapper. User can search their favorite games, and add it to the list to display in homr screen.
