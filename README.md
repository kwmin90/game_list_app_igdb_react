# game_list_app_igdb_react

Built using: React, react-router-dom

# Before running the app, make sure you get an api key from https://www.igdb.com/api and create a file called .env with value REACT_APP_USER_KEY = your_user-key

I am trying to re-create my previous angular project using react and no bootstrap or IGDB API wrapper. I am practicing css grid.
